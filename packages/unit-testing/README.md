# SuiteCloud Unit Testing
Suitecloud Unit Testing allows you to use unit testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for your SDF projects.

## Prerequisites
The following software is required to use SuiteCloud Unit Testing package:

module.exports = SuiteCloudJestConfiguration.build({
  projectFolder: 'src', //or your project folder
  projectType: SuiteCloudJestConfiguration.ProjectType.ACP,
});
```

- For SuiteApps:
```
const SuiteCloudJestConfiguration = require("@oracle/suitecloud-unit-testing/SuiteCloudJestConfiguration");

module.exports = SuiteCloudJestConfiguration.build({
  projectFolder: 'src', //or your project folder
  projectType: SuiteCloudJestConfiguration.ProjectType.SUITEAPP,
});
```
